# This is a miscellaneous contrivance showing three WidgetCursors variously
# acting.  There's a base cursor starting undef or settable to a boat or
# umbrella, then a "heart" on and off under a timer, and a button drag
# cursor.  A button for the Gtk2::Ex::WidgetCursor->busy mechanism shows how
# it trumps them all (in this case for a 3 second sleep()).
#
# There's no priority level settings, we instead use the rule that the
# newest created has precedence (among equal priorities).  This means the
# heart trumps the base, and the button drag cursor which is created
# on-demand is the newest of all three when it exists.
