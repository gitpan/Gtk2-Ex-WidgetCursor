Gtk2::Ex::WidgetCursor helps you manage what mouse pointer cursor is
used in a widget's window.  You can setup for a base cursor, then
something special cursor during a drag, and perhaps a "watch" for a
busy state on top of one or both of those.

A global "busy" mechanism is included, as a convenient way to display
a wristwatch in all windows while away number crunching.

The only prerequisite is Gtk2-Perl.  The WidgetCursor home page is
